# Welcome to Your TBR!

https://tbr-client.vercel.app/landing-page

## summary
Your Tbr is an app designed to help avid readers keep track of their past and future reads, and keep them on track for their reading progress. The user can save books in folders to make them easier to find, meant for different genres, but they can be made to be anything. The reader can always view their books information, including a description, they can edit the book as desired, and they can mark the book as read when finished. When they do so, it moves the book to a different page that they can view at any time, which will also count how many books they've recorded so far!

## technologies
The client side of this app is built on React and React-router, deployed with vercel. The App.js file creates the routes and context, which the rest of the components access for the books, folders, and user information. The structure of the app is separated into different components, with most of the functionality of the components in other files, imported as needed.
